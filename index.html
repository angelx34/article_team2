                This convergence of insights underscores a critical challenge: while traditional degrees remain
                valuable, their utility is diminishing without a parallel emphasis on skill development, critical
                thinking, and continuous learning. As AI continues to automate routine tasks, the demand for
                human capabilities such as creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence will only
                intensify, making a proactive shift in educational paradigms essential for future workforce
                readiness.
                <br></br>
                As AI reshapes the job market, a new generation of college graduates faces an uncertain future.
                In “Degrees Without Skills,” Aliah Dosunmu highlights how Gen Z’s overreliance on tools like
                ChatGPT may leave them with diplomas but lacking practical, marketable skills. Lucia's analysis
                digs deeper into global trends, showing that strong government support and higher education
                levels can reduce unemployment — proving the issue isn’t AI itself, but how we respond to it.
                Saul’s personal take adds urgency, spotlighting how AI is shrinking entry-level roles and calling
                for systemic reform in education and hiring. Together, these perspectives paint a clear message:
                surviving the AI era requires more than a degree — it demands adaptability, real-world
                experience, and bold policy changes.

                <br>By: Saul
            </h2>
            <p>
                <br>
                To be completely honest, I too am finding it hard to break into today’s job market as a Computer Science
                major. I remember spending hours last winter combing through listings, just trying to find that one
                internship that matched my experience level. Even then, it felt like I was throwing my resume into a
                void.
                <br></br>
                According to Handshake, a platform widely used by college students and recent graduates,
                entry-level corporate roles tailored to this group have declined by 15%, while applications per job have
                surged by 30%. It’s safe to say that OppNet Fellows, no matter current year, will have to navigate
                uncertain
                waters throughout college and beyond. And there’s little reason to believe this trend will reverse any
                time soon — in fact, it’s likely to accelerate as AI continues to reshape the job market.
                <br></br>
                Advancements in generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) — tools like ChatGPT, DALL·E, and
                Midjourney, just to name a few — are rapidly changing how companies operate. Tasks that once required
                junior employees — such as writing press releases (communications assistants), generating design drafts
                (junior graphic designers), debugging simple code (entry-level software developers), or compiling
                research summaries (analyst interns) — can now be handled in seconds by AI. As a result, many of the
                roles that traditionally gave recent graduates a foothold in the workforce are being reduced,
                restructured, or eliminated altogether.
                <br></br>
                For students preparing to enter the workforce, this shift has created a deep sense of uncertainty.
                Many graduates are finding that the skills they’ve spent years mastering are no longer enough — or no
                longer in demand. As job descriptions change faster than university syllabi, students are left
                scrambling to adapt on their own, often without institutional support. The gap between education and
                employment has
                never felt wider.
                <br></br>
                Outside institutions like OppNet and CodePath are actively working to bridge the
                growing gap between education and the evolving demands of the AI-driven workforce through initiatives
                like the Next Step
                Apprenticeship. These organizations offer mentorship, technical training, and career support to students
                from underrepresented backgrounds, helping them gain the skills and confidence needed to compete in an
                increasingly automated job market. By creating accessible pathways into tech, they're not only filling
                knowledge gaps but also empowering a more diverse generation of innovators to shape the future of
                AI.
                <br><br>
                This shift isn’t confined to entry-level roles — entire job categories are being downsized or phased
                out altogether. Software engineering roles, for instance, have declined by 33% since 2020, hitting a
                five-year low. Another sector seeing major contraction is customer service: AI-powered chatbots and
                voice assistants have replaced thousands of human support agents, particularly in retail and tech.
                Microsoft alone saved $500 million by implementing AI in its call centers — while laying off over 15,000
                employees in 2025. Even when AI isn’t the direct cause of layoffs, the productivity it enables is
                fundamentally changing how companies approach staffing.
                <br><br>
                “I just graduated and now I feel like I’m fighting an uphill battle,” my brother told me. He recently
                earned a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science from Cornell University and is now planning to pursue a
                master’s degree. To help cover the cost, he’s looking for a part-time job. “It’s frustrating knowing the
                opportunities I expected just aren’t there anymore.”
                <br><br>
                As AI continues to reshape the job market at an
                unprecedented pace, it’s imperative that education systems, employers, and policymakers work together to
                bridge the growing gap between skills and
                opportunity. Universities must integrate AI literacy and practical training into their curricula, while
                companies should rethink how they recruit and support early-career talent in this new landscape. Without
                deliberate action, we risk leaving an entire generation scrambling for footing in a workforce that’s
                evolving faster than they can keep up. The future of work depends not just on technology, but on how we
                prepare people to thrive alongside it.

            <h2 class="articleTitle">Beyond the Digital Takeover: Why New Graduates Need More Than Just AI Anxiety
                <br> By: Lucia
            </h2>
            <br>
            The specter of artificial intelligence stealing jobs has dominated headlines and graduation
            speeches alike. Yet while new graduates nervously scan job boards wondering if their degrees
            will be obsolete before they're even hired, we're missing a more nuanced—and
            actionable—conversation about unemployment in the AI era.
            <br></br>
            Recent research analyzing 24 high-tech developed countries from 2005-2021 reveals a
            surprising truth: there is indeed "a negative relationship between AI, machine learning, data
            science, and unemployment." The feared "displacement effect" is real. But here's what the
            doomsday narratives miss—the same research shows an equally significant relationship
            between government spending and unemployment rates. While we obsess over robots taking
            our jobs, we're ignoring the policy levers that could actually help.
            <br></br>
            The relationship between AI and employment isn't a simple story of human versus machine.
            Comparative studies across the United States, Germany, and Japan reveal that the impact of
            job computerization varies dramatically based on education levels and national approaches to
            workforce development.
            <br></br>
            In Germany, job computerization actually increases employment for high-risk occupations—but
            only when workers have bachelor's degrees or higher. Meanwhile, in Japan, higher
            computerization correlates with increased employment across all risk groups, again primarily for
            those with advanced education. The pattern is clear: higher educational attainment serves as a
            buffer against AI displacement.
            <br></br>
            But education alone isn't enough. The research shows that "occupations with higher-than-mean
            educational requirements sustain higher employment levels, regardless of the probability of
            being fully computerized." This suggests that the solution isn't just about getting more
            degrees—it's about developing the right skills and ensuring those skills are valued in the
            market.
            <br><br>
            Here's where the conversation gets interesting—and where policymakers should pay attention.
            While businesses and individuals scramble to adapt to AI disruption, Bureau of Labor Statistics
            data reveals a stark disparity in job availability. There are significantly more job openings in
            nonfarm and private sectors than in government positions, yet government employment remains
            one of the most stable sectors for new graduates.
            <br><br>
            The research on AI's impact consistently shows that government spending has a significant
            negative correlation with unemployment. This isn't just academic theory—it's a policy tool we're
            underutilizing. As we worry about AI displacing workers, we could be creating more public
            sector opportunities that both employ graduates and address societal needs that AI can't fulfill:
            social services, public administration, and community-focused roles.
            <br><br>
            The anxiety surrounding AI and employment is understandable, but it's leading to the wrong
            solutions. Instead of just learning to code or desperately pivoting to "AI-proof" careers, new
            graduates need a more strategic approach.
            <br><br>
            First, develop systematic disciplinary thinking. AI excels at understanding complex systems and
            variable transformations, but it lacks "situational generality"—the ability to apply knowledge
            flexibly across different contexts. Graduates who can integrate knowledge across disciplines
            and adapt to changing situations will remain valuable.
            <br><br>
            <span class="trigger" data-image="/images/AfterGraduating.jpg"> Second, embrace the reality that employment
                is now "an important step in the continuous </span>
            process of self-development and career growth." The days of stable, predictable career paths
            are over, AI or no AI. Success requires continuous learning, adaptability, and the ability to work
            alongside new technologies rather than in competition with them.
            <br><br>
            Third, recognize that some of the most promising opportunities exist in sectors where human
            judgment, creativity, and interpersonal skills remain essential. The research suggests that
            graduates should consider government and public service roles, where job stability is higher
            and the work often requires the kind of contextual decision-making that AI struggles with.
            <br><br>
            The AI employment debate has become frustratingly binary: either AI will eliminate all jobs, or it
            will create new ones to replace those lost. The reality, as the research shows, is far more
            complex and country-specific. Different labor market institutions, educational systems, and
            policy approaches lead to dramatically different outcomes.
            <br><br>
            For new graduates facing this uncertainty, the message isn't to panic or to dismiss AI concerns
            entirely. Instead, it's to recognize that successful navigation of the AI-influenced job market
            requires both individual adaptation and systemic support. While graduates work on developing
            flexible, interdisciplinary skills and maintaining lifelong learning mindsets, policymakers should
            focus on the proven relationship between government spending and employment.
            <br><br>
            The future of work won't be determined solely by technological advancement—it will be shaped
            by the choices we make about education, policy, and how we structure our economies. For new
            graduates, that's actually good news. It means they have more agency in this transition than the
            headlines suggest, and it means the solutions involve more than just learning to prompt
            ChatGPT effectively.
            <br><br>
            The robot takeover narrative makes for compelling clickbait, but it obscures the real work of
            building an economy that works for humans and machines alike. New graduates don't need to
            fear AI—they need better policies, more strategic education, and a job market that values the
            uniquely human skills they bring to an increasingly automated world.

            <h2 class="articleTitle"> Degrees Without Skills: How Gen Z’s AI Dependence Is Causing a Job Crisis <br> By:
                Aliah </h2>
            <br>
            As graduation season rolls around again, thousands of Gen Z college students are entering into the job
            market
            with this piece of paper that symbolizes all the “hard work” they've done in the last four years and very
            little
            else. Although this piece of paper is considered gold in the working industry it has no value if you can't
            actually
            do the work. Too many new grads are entering the workforce with a resume full of AI-written papers but no
            actual
            skills. But employers are starting to catch on.
            <br></br>
            To be honest we know that many are using AI as a source of intelligence rather than a tool to boost skills
            you already
            have. Tools like ChatGPT have made it easier than ever to generate robotic essays, solve equations, and even
            write
            code with little effort. But that convenience comes at a cost. When students use AI as their only source of
            intelligence
            they graduate with credentials but no confidence, no compression of the actual profession they “studied” for
            and ultimately,
            no career.
            <br></br>
            Use this as an example: If a computer science student heavily relies on AI throughout college. They use
            ChatGPT to complete
            most of their programming assignments, always pass take home tests with flying colors etc. Four years later,
            they graduate
            — only to fail the entrance exam for developer role. Why? Because they don’t know how to code without AI and
            their degree is
            just paper they wasted thousands of dollars on.
            <br></br>
            This isn’t just theory. According to a recent report from the National Association of Colleges and Employers
            (NACE), only
            about 53.2% of the Class of 2023 had full-time job offers within six months of graduation which is a huge
            drop from previous
            years. Employers emphasized that they are noticing a lack of critical thinking, problem-solving and
            communication skills as key
            reasons not accepting many new applicants or failed interviews. These are all areas where over reliance on
            AI leads to
            underperformance and an un successful career.
            <br></br>
            What happens if this trend continues? We could be looking at a workforce crisis where college graduates are
            underemployed — stuck
            in low-wage jobs not because they lack education, but because they lack experience and practical ability.
            With rising tuition and
            living costs, this is a recipe for financial instability and a frustrated, disillusioned generation.
            <br><br>
            <span class="trigger" data-image="/images/AfterGraduating.jpg"> It’s important to note that the problem
                isn’t AI itself. Used correctly, AI can be an incredible learning aid. It can help </span>
            brainstorm ideas, troubleshoot errors, and explain complex concepts. But the line between using and abusing
            AI is thin — and
            too many students cross it. The issue is how we’re teaching students to use these tools, and whether
            colleges are holding
            them accountable for actual learning.
            <br><br>
            So what’s the solution?
            <br><br>
            Colleges need to adapt — fast. That means creating academic policies that encourage responsible AI use while
            still prioritizing
            skill development. Professors should integrate AI literacy into their curricula, teaching students when and
            how to use tools
            like ChatGPT — and when to rely on their own knowledge. Schools can also introduce more practical exams,
            in-person projects,
            and peer-led coding or writing sessions that AI can’t complete for students.
            <br><br>
            Employers, too, have a role. Companies should consider offering skills-based hiring assessments rather than
            relying solely on
            degrees. Apprenticeships and internships — paid and accessible — should be more widely available to help
            grads gain the
            hands-on experience they clearly need.
            <br><br>
            The reality is this: A degree used to guarantee a job. Now, it only opens a door. To walk through it,
            graduates need something
            more — real, tested, marketable skills. If we don’t address this now, we risk creating a generation of
            workers who know how
            to prompt AI but don’t know how to work.
            <br><br>
            Let’s not wait until the next wave of college graduates hits the job market unprepared. It’s time to rebuild
            our education
            system — with intention, with integrity, and with the future in mind.
