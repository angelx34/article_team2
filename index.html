            <p> Undergraduate student-parents are a largely invisible population on
                Columbia’s campus. Without a kid by their side, they tend to blend in with the rest of
                the School of General Studies student body to which most of them belong. They take the
                same classes as other students, chase the same deadlines, and walk the same hallways—but
                it’s their family lives, child care responsibilities, and sheer determination to juggle
                raising a family while pursuing a degree that largely go unseen. Their experiences are
                marked by love and perseverance, but also by some of the most grueling schedules in the
                undergraduate body. Balancing lectures and school lunches, finals and high fevers, these
                students live in a constant state of negotiation between being a good parent and a good
                student.</p>
            <p> According to a University spokesperson, approximately 125 students
                identified as parents in a 2023 student survey conducted by the School of General
                Studies. While Columbia offers some forms of tailored support such as child care
                discounts, emergency housing, and academic accommodations, many student-parents find
                that these resources are difficult to access and tend to be reactive rather than
                proactive. With a lack of infrastructure designed to anticipate their needs, similar
                crises repeat themselves from one family to the next, whether it be mental health
                struggles or difficulty finding housing. In the absence of centralized, easy-to-find
                resources, many rely on luck, personal advocacy, or informal networks found through word
                of mouth.</p>
            <p> The Eye spoke with four of these parents, offering a glimpse into the
                resilience required to navigate this path and the cracks in the system that make that
                level of resilience necessary.</p>

            <p> As Benson and I neared the end of our interview, he asked me a question
                which I’ve come to see as emblematic of many aspects of the student-parent experience at
                Columbia.</p>
            <p> "Each of these student-parents has pushed forward not in spite of their
                families, but because of them. Yet that perseverance often comes at a steep cost: to
                their health, their security, their dreams, or their sense of belonging on campus.
                Columbia’s current supports, while meaningful in moments of crisis, often seem to serve
                as Band-Aids rather than building blocks—isolated fixes rather than sustainable
                infrastructure.</p>
            <p> For Webster, there are moments when it feels like too much—when the grief,
                the pressure, and the exhaustion threaten to take over.</p>
            <p>“There’s times where I’m like, I just wanna quit,” she admitted. “I wanna
                give up. I just wanna, like, go back to Maryland or Pittsburgh and just forget getting
                this degree and just get a basic job that I’m not happy at, like everybody else in
                America, right?”</p>
            <p>“But each time, her children talk her out of it.”</p>
            <p>“They’re like, ‘No, no mom, you gotta see this through.’ And their dad
                would have wanted me to finish too,” Webster reflected. “So that’s the other reason why
                I do it. Because he didn’t like me giving up.”</p>
