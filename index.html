            <p> To be completely honest, I too am finding it hard to break into today’s job market as a Computer Science
                major. I remember spending hours last winter combing through listings, just trying to find that one
                internship that matched my experience level. Even then, it felt like I was throwing my resume into a
                void.
                <br></br>
                According to Handshake, a platform widely used by college students and recent graduates,
                entry-level corporate roles tailored to this group have declined by 15%, while applications per job have
                surged by 30%. It’s safe to say that OppNet Fellows, no matter current year, will have to navigate uncertain
                waters throughout college and beyond. And there’s little reason to believe this trend will reverse any
                time soon — in fact, it’s likely to accelerate as AI continues to reshape the job market.
                <br></br>
                Advancements in generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) — tools like ChatGPT, DALL·E, and
                Midjourney, just to name a few — are rapidly changing how companies operate. Tasks that once required
                junior employees — such as writing press releases (communications assistants), generating design drafts
                (junior graphic designers), debugging simple code (entry-level software developers), or compiling
                research summaries (analyst interns) — can now be handled in seconds by AI. As a result, many of the
                roles that traditionally gave recent graduates a foothold in the workforce are being reduced,
                restructured, or eliminated altogether.
                <br></br>
                For students preparing to enter the workforce, this shift has created a deep sense of uncertainty.
                Many graduates are finding that the skills they’ve spent years mastering are no longer enough — or no
                longer in demand. As job descriptions change faster than university syllabi, students are left
                scrambling to adapt on their own, often without institutional support. The gap between education and employment has
                never felt wider.
                <br></br>
                Outside institutions like OppNet and CodePath are actively working to bridge the
                growing gap between education and the evolving demands of the AI-driven workforce through initiatives like the Next Step
                Apprenticeship. These organizations offer mentorship, technical training, and career support to students
                from underrepresented backgrounds, helping them gain the skills and confidence needed to compete in an
                increasingly automated job market. By creating accessible pathways into tech, they're not only filling
                knowledge gaps but also empowering a more diverse generation of innovators to shape the future of
                AI.
                <br><br>
                This shift isn’t confined to entry-level roles — entire job categories are being downsized or phased
                out altogether. Software engineering roles, for instance, have declined by 33% since 2020, hitting a
                five-year low. Another sector seeing major contraction is customer service: AI-powered chatbots and
                voice assistants have replaced thousands of human support agents, particularly in retail and tech.
                Microsoft alone saved $500 million by implementing AI in its call centers — while laying off over 15,000
                employees in 2025. Even when AI isn’t the direct cause of layoffs, the productivity it enables is
                fundamentally changing how companies approach staffing.
                <br><br>
                “I just graduated and now I feel like I’m fighting an uphill battle,” my brother told me. He recently earned a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science from Cornell University and is now planning to pursue a
                master’s degree. To help cover the cost, he’s looking for a part-time job. “It’s frustrating knowing the
                opportunities I expected just aren’t there anymore.” 
                <br><br>
                As AI continues to reshape the job market at an
                unprecedented pace, it’s imperative that education systems, employers, and policymakers work together to bridge the growing gap between skills and
                opportunity. Universities must integrate AI literacy and practical training into their curricula, while
                companies should rethink how they recruit and support early-career talent in this new landscape. Without
                deliberate action, we risk leaving an entire generation scrambling for footing in a workforce that’s
                evolving faster than they can keep up. The future of work depends not just on technology, but on how we
                prepare people to thrive alongside it.
