        <p> "Undergraduate student-parents are a largely invisible population on
            Columbia’s campus. Without a kid by their side, they tend to blend in with the rest of
            the School of General Studies student body to which most of them belong. They take the
            same classes as other students, chase the same deadlines, and walk the same hallways—but
            it’s their family lives, child care responsibilities, and sheer determination to juggle
            raising a family while pursuing a degree that largely go unseen. Their experiences are
            marked by love and perseverance, but also by some of the most grueling schedules in the
            undergraduate body. Balancing lectures and school lunches, finals and high fevers, these
            students live in a constant state of negotiation between being a good parent and a good
            student." </p> 
        <p> " According to a University spokesperson, approximately 125 students
            identified as parents in a 2023 student survey conducted by the School of General
            Studies. While Columbia offers some forms of tailored support such as child care
            discounts, emergency housing, and academic accommodations, many student-parents find
            that these resources are difficult to access and tend to be reactive rather than
            proactive. With a lack of infrastructure designed to anticipate their needs, similar
            crises repeat themselves from one family to the next, whether it be mental health
            struggles or difficulty finding housing. In the absence of centralized, easy-to-find
            resources, many rely on luck, personal advocacy, or informal networks found through word
            of mouth. " </p>
        <p>   "The Eye spoke with four of these parents, offering a glimpse into the
            resilience required to navigate this path and the cracks in the system that make that
            level of resilience necessary. " </p>

    <p>  "As Benson and I neared the end of our interview, he asked me a question
        which I’ve come to see as emblematic of many aspects of the student-parent experience at
        Columbia." </p>
    <p> "Each of these student-parents has pushed forward not in spite of their
        families, but because of them. Yet that perseverance often comes at a steep cost: to
        their health, their security, their dreams, or their sense of belonging on campus.
        Columbia’s current supports, while meaningful in moments of crisis, often seem to serve
        as Band-Aids rather than building blocks—isolated fixes rather than sustainable
        infrastructure. " </p>
    <p>" For Webster, there are moments when it feels like too much—when the grief,
        the pressure, and the exhaustion threaten to take over. " </p>
    <p  >" “There’s times where I’m like, I just wanna quit,” she admitted. “I wanna
        give up. I just wanna, like, go back to Maryland or Pittsburgh and just forget getting
        this degree and just get a basic job that I’m not happy at, like everybody else in
        America, right?” "</p>
    <p>  "But each time, her children talk her out of it".</p>
    <p >  “They’re like, ‘No, no mom, you gotta see this through.’ And their dad
        would have wanted me to finish too,” Webster reflected. “So that’s the other reason why
        I do it. Because he didn’t like me giving up.” </p>
